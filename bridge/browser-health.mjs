/**
 * Detect and clear targets that have stopped answering CDP.
 *
 * All three browser servers die together when a single target wedges, and the
 * failure is invisible from the outside: the browser looks fine, /json/version
 * answers in milliseconds, every tab renders. What breaks is that Playwright and
 * Puppeteer both enable Runtime and Network on EVERY target when they connect,
 * and then wait for all of it. One target that never replies blocks the whole
 * connect, so the agent gets a 30 second timeout on every browser call and no
 * indication of why.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-27, the second timeout in two days: 735 CDP commands sent on
 * connect, 712 answered, 23 unanswered. Those 23 came from exactly two targets,
 * one wedged Google Calendar tab and WhatsApp Web's WASM VoIP workers. With
 * those two cleared, connectOverCDP went from a hard 30s timeout to 935ms.
 *
 * The agent cannot route around this. On that run it tried brave, brave-repl and
 * devtools, got a timeout from all three, and spent its remaining budget writing
 * a raw CDP client in Bash because raw CDP can talk to one target without
 * enabling anything on the others. That worked, and it is also the reason the
 * task was never finished.
 *
 * So this runs before the agent does, not as advice to it.
 *
 * WhatsApp respawns its workers immediately, so closing them is not a fix on its
 * own. It is still correct to close them: a respawned worker is usually healthy,
 * and the one that was blocking is gone.
