 * back across sessions, which nothing was doing.
 *
 * This is that look back. It runs on a timer, reads whatever transcripts are new
 * since the last run, and hands them to a Claude Code session whose only job is
 * to update the memory tree. The judgement stays in the model; this file just
 * decides what it gets to see.
 *
 * What it feeds in is deliberately narrow. A transcript averages 1.5MB, almost
 * all of it tool calls and their results, which are noise for this purpose. What
 * matters is what the user asked, what was reported back, and above all where
 * the user pushed back. A correction is the single highest-signal event
 * available: it is the user stating a preference in the one moment they cared
 * enough to interrupt.

Below are two things: a digest of how the user has actually been using their
browser when nobody asked them anything, and transcripts of conversations
between the user and you with tool calls stripped out.

The browsing digest is the more interesting half, because it shows work you were
never told about. A site appearing there that never appears in a conversation is
a project you do not know exists. Sites they return to daily are the tools they
live in. The busiest hours are their working day. Note these as facts about the
user, not as a list of URLs, and never write anything that reads like a
surveillance log.

Lines marked [PUSHBACK] are moments the user corrected,
contradicted or redirected you. Those are the most valuable lines here: a
correction is the user stating a preference at the one moment they cared enough
to interrupt.

Your job is to update the memory tree in \`memory/\` so that a future session
starts already knowing what these sessions taught. Read the existing files first.

What to write:

- **Facts about the user.** How they phrase things, what they consider done, what
  annoys them, what they ask for repeatedly, the vocabulary they use for their own
  tools and projects. This is the category that is currently thinnest and the one
  that makes the difference between a tool and a companion.
- **Corrections, as rules.** "He asked twice for the answer before the detail" is
  a fact. Turn it into the rule it implies.
- **Site and workflow specifics** you had to discover.

What NOT to write:

- Anything you could re-derive in ten seconds.
- One-off task details. "Marked OOO on 25 Aug" is history, not memory.
- Secrets. No passwords, tokens or codes, ever, whatever appeared in a transcript.
- Anything about a person other than the user unless it changes how you should act.

How to write it:

- **Merge, do not append.** If a file already covers the topic, edit that section.
  A memory tree that grows by accretion becomes unreadable and then unread.
- **Date anything that supersedes an earlier note**, and delete what it replaces.
  A file that contradicts itself with no ordering is worse than one that is stale.
- Put facts in \`memory/\`; put repeatable procedures in \`skills/\` instead.
  Write to \`skills/\`, never \`.claude/skills/\`: that path is a symlink to it and
  the harness refuses any write inside \`.claude/\`.
- Keep \`CLAUDE.md\`'s index accurate if you add a file.
- Be brief. Every line here is paid for on every future session.

At the end, output a short plain-text summary of what you changed and why. If the
sessions taught nothing durable, say so and change nothing. That is a valid and
common outcome, and inventing a lesson to look productive is worse than silence.`;
