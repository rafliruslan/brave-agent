/**
 * One bridge per machine.
 *
 * Socket Mode allows several concurrent connections and Slack delivers
 * `app_mention` to every one of them. Two bridges therefore answer every
 * mention twice, with two different agents reaching two different results in
 * the same thread. The failure is invisible from the outside: nothing errors,
 * the user just sees the agent contradict itself and assumes it is flaky.
 *
 * systemd already prevents two copies of the same unit. It does not prevent a
 * hand-run `node index.mjs` beside the service, which is exactly what happens
 * while developing, so this covers that case.
 *
 * A dead holder must never block a restart, so the lock records a pid and is
 * taken over when that pid is gone. `process.kill(pid, 0)` sends no signal, it
 * only asks whether the process exists.
 *
 * That question is not the one we need answered. It proves SOME process has
 * that pid, not that it is the bridge. Pids are reassigned across a reboot, so
 * a lock left behind by a killed bridge gets adopted by whatever inherits its
 * number. This bridge sat down for three days because pid 1018 came back as an
 * Apple XPC service 36 seconds after boot, and launchd retried against it every
 * 30 seconds, refusing to start each time. Hence the boot-time check: a lock
 * taken before this boot cannot have a live holder, whatever its pid says now.
