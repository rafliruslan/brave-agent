/**
 * In-flight runs, so a restart does not leave a "running…" message hanging.
 *
 * The bridge posts a placeholder, runs the agent, then edits the placeholder
 * with the result. If the process dies in between, nothing ever edits it and
 * the message says "running…" forever. Observed on a real thread: a placeholder
 * from 12:38 was still hanging after a restart at 21:41.
 *
 * Recording the placeholder before the run and clearing it after means anything
 * left in this file at startup is by definition an orphan.
