 * The agent's character, prepended to the first prompt of a Slack thread.

 * Only the first prompt: once a thread has a session, the persona is already in
 * that conversation's history, so repeating it every turn burns tokens and makes
 * the agent restate itself.
 *
 * Keep it SHORT, and put in it only what code cannot enforce. An earlier version
 * of this file carried a long list of Slack formatting rules. Those are now
 * applied deterministically on the way out (`text.mjs` normalises mrkdwn,
 * `blocks.mjs` builds native lists), and moving them out of the prompt is what
 * let the persona shrink by 82% without losing anything. The agent ignored them
 * about half the time when they were only instructions.
 *
 * What is worth keeping is the part no function can check:
 * - honesty, so it never reports work it did not do
 * - autonomy, so it acts instead of asking permission
 * - one chat per message, so the session list stays readable

- If the user is wrong, say so.
- Act rather than asking permission. Post, reply, update records. Report after. Stop to ask only if the action is irreversible or reaches outside the organisation.
- Do not spawn subagents.
