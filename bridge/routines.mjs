/**
 * Run scheduled routines from the memory tree.
 *
 * A routine is a markdown file in `memory/routines/` describing recurring work:
 * how to do it, what has broken before, and a log of runs. Until now those were
 * documentation and nothing executed them.
 *
 * This wakes on a timer, finds routines whose schedule is due, and runs each one
 * as a Claude Code session with its own file as the task. The file is both the
 * instruction and the memory, which is the point: a routine that discovers
 * something writes it back into the same page the next run reads.
 *
 * Three design choices worth stating, because each prevents a specific failure:
 *
 *   1. NOTIFY ONLY unless a routine opts in. An unattended agent acting on a
 *      schedule with nobody reading is the riskiest thing in this system. The
 *      predecessor to one of these routines tried to auto-approve a person by
 *      name, never matched because he had registered under his wife's name, and
 *      was deleted. Reporting is the safe default; acting is a decision.
 *
 *   2. ONE LINE PER RUN in the log. The system this came from wrote a paragraph
 *      per run and after fifteen runs the log was the same sentence repeated,
 *      with the genuinely useful findings buried inside it.
 *
 *   3. A MISSED RUN IS NOT RETRIED. If the machine was asleep at 09:00 the run
 *      is skipped, not fired late. A payout reminder that arrives at midnight
 *      because the laptop woke up is worse than one that did not arrive.
