/**
 * Runs one the agent turn against Claude Code.
 *
 * This is the module that replaced the macOS-only `runner.mjs`, which shelled
 * out to a macOS-only agent CLI. Everything else in the bridge is unchanged.
 *
 * Four findings drove the original design against that CLI. Three of
 * them do not survive the move, because Claude Code has a structured interface
 * that Claude Code has and it did not:
 *
 *   F1 session id is undiscoverable  -> gone. `--session-id <uuid>` assigns it.
 *   F2 exits 0 on hard errors        -> gone. JSON carries `is_error`/`subtype`.
 *   F3 ANSI escapes in stdout        -> gone. JSON on stdout.
 *   F4 hangs unless stdin is closed  -> STILL APPLIES. Node's spawn default is
 *      stdio ['pipe','pipe','pipe'], leaving the child holding a stdin pipe
 *      that never reaches EOF. Measured on the Mac: hung >35s vs 779ms with
 *      stdin ignored. No mocked-spawn unit test can catch this.
 *
 * Also measured, and contrary to what the previous harness did: a headless
 * Claude Code run that hits a permission boundary does NOT hang. It records the
 * refusal in `permission_denials`, tells the user plainly, and exits success in
 * ~12s. That is why this runner uses a real permission mode and a scoped cwd
 * rather than bypassing permissions to avoid a stall that cannot happen.

/**
 * Tools the agent must never get, enforced in code rather than in the persona.

 * deterministic MUST be, which is also what let the persona shrink 82%.
 *
 * `Task`                            one Slack message must be one session, or a
 *                                   single mention becomes four sidebar entries.

 * `mcp__brave__browser_run_code_unsafe`
 *                                   arbitrary JS against a live logged-in page.
 *                                   Observed 2026-08-25: `browser_click` cannot
 *                                   work on Google Calendar (the ref resolves
 *                                   but Playwright's stability check never
 *                                   passes), the agent escalated to raw JS against a
 *                                   half-open dialog, and left a ghost "No
 *                                   title" out-of-office event that then had to
 *                                   be hunted down. `browser_evaluate` against a
 *                                   specific ref is the supported escape hatch
 *                                   and is still allowed; unscoped page scripting
 *                                   is not.
 *
 * `mcp__devtools__evaluate_script`
 *                                   the chrome-devtools-mcp equivalent of the
 *                                   above. Denied for the same reason, so
 *                                   adding a second browser server does not
 *                                   quietly reopen the door we just shut.
 *
 * Aside, the macOS browser layer, cannot be constrained this way and it is
 * worth being blunt about it. `aside mcp` exposes exactly one tool, `repl`,
 * which executes arbitrary JavaScript against the live logged-in browser. There
 * is no granular `click(ref)` to allow instead, so the capability these two
 * entries exist to remove IS the entire API. Denying it would leave the agent
 * with no browser; allowing it grants, on that machine, precisely what was
 * taken away on the other one.
 *
 * So the guardrail on macOS is not the tool list. It is the workspace cwd, the
 * single allowed Slack user, and the fact that a human reads every reply. That
 * is a real reduction in safety against the Linux setup, and someone running
 * both should know which machine they are talking to.
 *
 * The two Brave entries stay listed on both. They cost nothing when the server
 * is absent, and leaving them means attaching Brave later cannot quietly reopen
 * a door that was shut deliberately.
