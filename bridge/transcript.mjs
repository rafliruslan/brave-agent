 * Reading past sessions back.

 * has never had is a way to LOOK at what it has done: threads.json records only
 * whether a session exists, and the sessions themselves are Claude Code's own
 * JSONL transcripts, which nothing here reads.
 *
 * So this is a reading problem, not a storage one. Nothing new is written. The
 * transcripts are the durable record - threads.json prunes after a week, the
 * transcripts do not - and `claude --resume <id>` already replays any of them.
 *
 * Pure functions over strings and objects, so the awkward parts (a persona
 * prepended to turn one, a half-written line at the end of a live session) are
 * testable without a transcript on disk.

 *
 * A session that straddles the switch reads slightly short for one listing:
 * our copy begins at the turn we started mirroring, so its task line is that
 * turn rather than the thread's opening one. That is the price of not reading
 * a file whose schema we do not control, and it clears itself.
