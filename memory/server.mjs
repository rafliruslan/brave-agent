/**
 * memory: ranked search over the agent's own memory files.
 *
 * Aside gained `memory_search` in 1.26. The agent has always been able to Grep
 * and Read `memory/`, so this is not new capability so much as new economics:
 * one call that returns two paragraphs instead of a Grep, a decision, and a
 * Read of a whole file to reach them.
 *
 * It is a SEPARATE server on purpose. brave-repl is listed only in the Brave
 * config, so a tool added there would exist on Linux and silently not on
 * macOS - and the whole point of matching Aside here is that the persona reads
 * the same on both machines. This server goes in mcp.json AND mcp.aside.json.
 *
 * It touches no browser, so unlike the other servers it still answers when the
 * browser is down, which is exactly when someone is asking the agent what
 * happened.
