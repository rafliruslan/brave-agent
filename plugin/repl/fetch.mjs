/**
 * The policy and formatting half of the `fetch` tool. No browser here, so it
 * can be tested.
 *
 * Why this tool exists: Aside's site skills say "don't have to open a browser
 * tab" for Gmail, Docs, Sheets and Notion. That is the real gap against a
 * DOM-driving agent, and it is not that Aside clicks better - it is that it
 * often does not click at all. It uses the logged-in session as an HTTP client.
 * A Google Calendar out-of-office event took ~15 tool calls through the DOM;
 * the same thing is one request to an endpoint the page already calls.
 *
 * Why it is a separate TOOL and not an `act` op: denial is per tool. An op
 * inside `act` could only be removed by removing all of `act`, and the reason
 * `act` has a closed enum at all is that a dangerous capability should be
 * removable - which is how `browser_run_code_unsafe` came to be denied here.
 * One `--deniedTools mcp__brave-repl__fetch` turns this off and leaves the rest.
 *
 * Why same-origin, enforced here rather than left to the browser: the request
 * runs inside a page that is already signed in, so it carries that session's
 * cookies. Without the origin check this stops being "read the Gmail you are
 * logged into" and becomes "make authenticated requests to anywhere, from
 * inside the user's browser". CORS would refuse most cross-origin calls anyway,
 * but a policy that depends on the target site's headers is not a policy.
